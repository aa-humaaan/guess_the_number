## Advanced Guess the Number Game

This Python program implements a guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a customizable range. It offers the following features:

* **Configurable Range:** The user can define the minimum and maximum values for the guessing range, ensuring they fall within a valid range (1 to 10 for minimum and 1 to 20 for maximum).
* **Clear Feedback:** The user receives informative feedback for invalid input, exceeding the attempt limit, or providing guesses outside the defined range. 
* **Adaptive Attempts:** The number of attempts scales proportionally to the chosen range, providing a more balanced challenge.

**How to Play:**

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script (e.g., guess_the_number.py).
3. Run the script using `python guess_the_number.py`.
4. You will be prompted to enter the minimum and maximum values for the guessing range. Ensure the minimum value is between 1 and 10, and the maximum value is greater than the minimum and less than or equal to 20.
5. The game will begin, and you will have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.

**Example Gameplay:**

```
Welcome to Guess the Number Game! I am thinking a number between 5 and 15. Can you guess it?
Enter your guess (should be between 5 and 15): 12
Too low! Try again. You have 7 attempts left.
Enter your guess (should be between 5 and 15): 18
Please enter a number less than or equal to 15.
Enter your guess (should be between 5 and 15): 14
Congratulations! You've guessed the number 14 correctly in 2 attempts!
