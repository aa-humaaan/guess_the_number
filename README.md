**Advanced Guess the Number Game**

This Python program implements a guessing game where the user tries to identify a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game offers a configurable difficulty level based on the range and provides feedback to guide the user towards the correct answer.

**Features:**

* Customizable range: Allows users to define the minimum and maximum values for the secret number.
* Difficulty adjustment: The number of attempts scales with the range size, providing a more challenging experience with wider ranges.
* User-friendly feedback: Provides hints like "Too low" or "Too high" to help the user guess correctly.
* Clear instructions: Guides the user through the gameplay process.

**How to Play:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script (e.g., guess_the_number.py).
3. Run the script using `python guess_the_number.py`.
4. The program will prompt you to enter the desired minimum and maximum values for the guessing range (defaults to 1 and 20).
5. You'll then have a limited number of attempts (based on the range) to guess the secret number.
6. The program will provide feedback after each guess to help you hone in on the correct answer.

**Example Gameplay:**

```
Welcome to Guess the Number Game! I am thinking a number between 5 and 30. Can you guess it?
Enter your guess: 15
Too low! Try again. You have 13 attempts left.
Enter your guess: 22
Too high! Try again. You have 12 attempts left.
Enter your guess: 27
Congratulations! You've guessed the number 28 correctly in 3 attempts!
```

**Feel free to modify the code to adjust the gameplay experience further!**

**Dependencies:**

* Python 3 (or later)

**Additional Notes:**

* The code utilizes the `random` module to generate random numbers.
* Error handling is included to catch invalid user input (non-numeric values).

I hope you enjoy this game!
